Welcome to the Anime Title Management System project! This project is a comprehensive exploration of advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and the development of a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI). The primary objective of this project is to provide a platform for users to save and manage a list of anime titles, complete with associated synopses and reviews. Users have the flexibility to save and sort anime titles using various criteria. Additionally, the project covers different methods of data persistence, including Text, Object, and Binary file formats.
